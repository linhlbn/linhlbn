### About me
Hi, I am Linh, you can call me J. Currently, I'm studying at HCMUS & AUT majoring in Computer Science.

As a lowkey introverted hybrid individual, I place great emphasis on core values and have no desire to showcase myself excessively. However, this does not imply that I am hard to approach; in fact, I am quite easy-going and can initiate conversations effortlessly. With time, I believe that you will find me to be quite witty and humorous beside those deeply meaningful stories. 

At workplace, I am confident in my ability to be a lone warrior or the best support to help or lead the team to great success. My core principle is that we should be friend first, then working is the second. Here are my various hobbies that It would fit with any cultures (I would love to share it here too): 

- Love [pop/ rap] Japanese/ Chinese/ Korean/ Vietnamese music, [metal] Finnish/ Swedish/ USUK music, [EDM] Big room, Electro Dance, Hardstyle & Rawstyle music
- Love jogging, singing, piano & kalimba
- Love learning new things in diverse areas: Economics, Sales & Marketing, Finance, etc..  
- and.. Meme (guest what is going on with below image ðŸ¤£)

### Stats
I love to see those stats, because I enjoy making process and being consistency like a adherent of Stoicism.
